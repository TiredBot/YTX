# YTX
YoutubeExtractor.  A python script for pulling videos from youtube for backup purposes and cutting them. Usable from the command line.

REQUIREMENTS
python3
pip
pytube
moviepy

To install pip packages with pip use :
  pip install pytube
  pip install moviepy

Troubleshooting
I've been using Python 3.9.0 and had some issues with the script running because I was using pytube3 from pip. After removing that and installing 'pytube' from pip there were no more problems.
